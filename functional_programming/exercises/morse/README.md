## Getting Started

Morse codes were used in the days of telegraphs and manual radio
communication. It is similar in the idea to Huffman coding in that it
uses fewer symbols for frequent occurring characters and more symbols
for the infrequent ones. You task is to write a decoder for Morse
signals and decode two secret messages.
